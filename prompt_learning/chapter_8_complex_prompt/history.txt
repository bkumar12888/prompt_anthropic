Customer: Give me two possible careers for sociology majors.

Joe: Here are two potential careers for sociology majors:

- Social worker - Sociology provides a strong foundation for understanding human behavior and social systems. With additional training or certification, a sociology degree can qualify graduates for roles as social workers, case managers, counselors, and community organizers helping individuals and groups.

- Human resources specialist - An understanding of group dynamics and organizational behavior from sociology is applicable to careers in human resources. Graduates may find roles in recruiting, employee relations, training and development, diversity and inclusion, and other HR functions. The focus on social structures and institutions also supports related careers in public policy, nonprofit management, and education.
